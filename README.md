# Interpretable Word Sense Representations via Definition Generation

This repository accompanies the paper [`Interpretable Word Sense Representations via Definition Generation: The Case of Semantic Change Analysis`](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.176/) (ACL'2023) by Mario Giulianelli, Iris Luden, Raquel Fern√°ndez and Andrey Kutuzov.

The project is a collaboration between the [Dialogue Modelling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/) at the University of Amsterdam 
and the [Language Technology Group](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/ltg/) at the University of Oslo.

## Definition generation models for English:
- [FLAN-T5-Definition Base (250M parameters)](https://huggingface.co/ltg/flan-t5-definition-en-base)
- [FLAN-T5-Definition Large (780M parameters)](https://huggingface.co/ltg/flan-t5-definition-en-large)
- [FLAN-T5-Definition XL (3B parameters)](https://huggingface.co/ltg/flan-t5-definition-en-xl)

See our [model hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/ltg/definition-modeling-6580c4598ecea67c7d5b1970) for more languages and newer models.


## Usage

### Download datasets

- [wordnet and oxford](https://github.com/shonosuke/ishiwatari-naacl2019#download-dataset)

*.txt files are tsv files containing the target words and their gold standard definitions.

*.eg files are tsv files containing the target words and their usage examples.

- [CoDWoE](https://github.com/TimotheeMickus/codwoe#using-the-datasets)

### Predict definitions

Gzip test.txt and test.eg files, put them into the same <testdata> folder and run code/modeling/generate_t5.py, e.g.

```commandline
python3 code/modeling/generate_t5.py --model ltg/flan-t5-definition-en-base --testdata testdata
```

### Generate DistilRoBERTa sentence embeddings for the definitions

code/modeling/generate_t5.py outputs a tsv file named as <prompt>_post_predicted.tsv. The gold standard definitions are in the Definition column, 
and the predicted ones are in the Definitions column. Run code/embed_definitions.py, e.g.

```commandline
python3 code/embed_definitions.py --input_path "what_is_the_definition_of_<trg>?_post_predicted.tsv" --key_to_entry_id Sense
```

key_to_entry_id depends on the dataset used. Sense is used in wordnet

    abstract = "We propose using automatically generated natural language definitions of contextualised word usages as interpretable word and word sense representations. Given a collection of usage examples for a target word, and the corresponding data-driven usage clusters (i.e., word senses), a definition is generated for each usage with a specialised Flan-T5 language model, and the most prototypical definition in a usage cluster is chosen as the sense label. We demonstrate how the resulting sense labels can make existing approaches to semantic change analysis more interpretable, and how they can allow users {---} historical linguists, lexicographers, or social scientists {---} to explore and intuitively explain diachronic trajectories of word meaning. Semantic change analysis is only one of many possible applications of the {`}definitions as representations{'} paradigm. Beyond being human-readable, contextualised definitions also outperform token or usage sentence embeddings in word-in-context semantic similarity judgements, making them a new promising type of lexical representation for NLP.",
